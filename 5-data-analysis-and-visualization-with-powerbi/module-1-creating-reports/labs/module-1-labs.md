#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Category Analysis:** Created a **Clustered Column Chart** to visualize *Order Total* by *Product Category*, allowing stakeholders to instantly compare revenue across different inventory segments.
* **Payment Insights:** Built a **Pie Chart** to show the distribution of *Order Total* by *Payment Method*, identifying the most popular transaction types.
* **Trend Tracking:** Implemented a **Line Chart** plotting *Order Total* against *Order Date* to reveal sales patterns and cycles over time.

#### Key Visuals Built:
* **KPI Cards:** Configured **Card** visuals to display headline metrics: *Total Sales*, *Average Sales*, and *Total Number of Orders*.
* **Marketing Analysis:** Designed a **Clustered Bar Chart** to compare *Total Marketing Spend* across different *Marketing Channels*.
* **Regional Performance:**
    * Built a **Clustered Column Chart** to rank *Total Sales* by *Product Region*.
    * Created a **Donut Chart** to visualize the percentage share of sales per region.
* **Correlation & Detail:** Implemented a **Matrix Visual** to analyze the relationship between *Sales* and *Advertising Campaigns* across different regions, allowing for granular drill-down into campaign effectiveness.

    * [📊 View Advanced Visuals](./labs/lab-3-creating-specialist-visualizations/Specialist_Charts.pbix)

#### Key Visuals Built:
* **Ranking Analysis:** Created a **Ribbon Chart** to track *Sales Ranking* changes between regions over time, highlighting when a region moved from 2nd to 1st place.
* **Process Flow:** Built a **Funnel Chart** to visualize the sales pipeline, tracking the conversion drop-off from "Lead" to "Finalized Sale."
* **Correlation Analysis:** Designed a **Scatter Chart** to plot *Marketing Spend* (X) vs. *Revenue* (Y), effectively identifying outlier campaigns that had high spend but low return.

#### Key Actions Performed:
* **Dashboard Construction:** Created a new **Dashboard** container in the Power BI Service.
* **Pinning:** Used the **"Pin Visual"** feature to move specific high-value charts (like the *Order Total Pie Chart*) from the detailed report to the executive dashboard.
* **Tile Management:** Resized and organized the pinned tiles to create a cohesive, single-screen view of the business's health.
